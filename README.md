# deckhand

*All hands on deck.* Two Claude Code skills that together automate a GitHub Projects v2 kanban workflow end-to-end.

- **`managing-project-backlog`** - the per-board operating manual. How to create epics, break them into sub-issues, move tickets through the kanban, assign owners, and keep the board healthy.
- **`ticket-lifecycle`** - the batch processing workflow on top. Take a set of issues, implement them in parallel, run isolated code review, fix feedback, watch CI, merge, and clean up the board.

The two pair best: `managing-project-backlog` defines the conventions; `ticket-lifecycle` applies them at speed across many tickets.

## Why this exists

I tried a lot of trackers - Linear, even building my own - before realising that for personal, vibe-coded projects, **GitHub Projects is free, already where the code lives, and perfectly viable**. The real unlock isn't the board itself, it's that it's a board *both you and your coding agent can drive*. Claude Code can read it, write to it, and move cards across it through the `gh` CLI - no extra SaaS subscription, no separate API, no glue code. It works in **Codex** too (I've run it there); since everything happens through `gh` and standard agent tooling, any agent that can run a shell can drive the same board. The plan lives somewhere you can both see and edit, and that shared source of truth is the whole point.

## How I use it

1. **Long planning session.** I talk the work through with Claude, then get it to break the outcome into **epics**.
2. **Claude writes its own tickets.** From each epic it drafts the sub-issues - `managing-project-backlog` keeps them structured and linked.
3. **I point at the work.** Either "take this epic", or something cross-cutting and end-to-end. I name ticket/epic numbers, or just drag cards into **Prioritized**.
4. **`ticket-lifecycle` takes over.** It picks up the specified work, dispatches **multiple subagents, each in its own git worktree**, and delivers the tickets in parallel.
5. **Quality gates, automatically.** Each PR gets a **fresh, isolated review agent**; the skill actions the feedback in a loop (up to 5 rounds) and waits for **CI to go green** at each step, if you've configured it.
6. **It tells me when it's done.** Set and forget.

Because the quality gates - independent PR review plus CI - are baked in, I get a genuine degree of confidence the work is *solid*, not just plausible. I've run this across several projects now and, when it's working (which is basically always), it lets me set and forget a lot of the work I'm doing.

A few honest notes:

- **Use Opus 4.8 (or the latest Opus).** The whole loop leans on the model's judgement - especially the reviewer. On a smaller model, your mileage will vary.
- **The `simplify` step matters.** Invoking it before review genuinely keeps the codebase clean as the project grows. Don't skip it lightly.
- **Use at your own risk** - but for me, across several projects, it's been reliable.

And yeah - there's a strange little buzz in watching tickets fly across the board into **Done** on their own.

## Tight context, big-picture awareness

Something I've found over the last couple of years: agents do their best work when they're handed a *hyper-specific* brief, but they still need to understand the wider goal, or you get technically-correct work that quietly misses the point. The board structure is what lets you give them both at once.

Each agent picks up a **single ticket** - that's the tight, specific brief. But because every ticket links back to its **parent epic** and sits alongside its **sibling tickets**, the agent can pull in just enough surrounding context to understand *what* it's building and *why it matters to the product*, without dragging the entire project history into its window. Add its read of the codebase it's touching, and that's the full picture it needs.

So the context stays deliberately tight: one clear task, the minimum surrounding detail to do it well, and an understanding of the product goal it serves. Narrow enough to stay focused, wide enough to make good calls. In my experience that combination is what gets you a genuinely good result rather than a merely plausible one.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed
- [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/) authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- `python3` available on `PATH` (used for JSON parsing - both skills assume it)
- A GitHub Projects v2 board attached to a single repo
- A `CLAUDE.md` at your repo root with project standards (optional but strongly recommended - the review phases lean on it)

### Recommended (optional)

- **The `simplify` skill** - `ticket-lifecycle` Phase 2.5 runs it on each change before review, so PRs reach the reviewer already de-duplicated and free of dead code. If it isn't installed the phase is skipped automatically (Phase 3's review still catches the same issues), so it's a nice-to-have, not a hard dependency.
- **A code-reviewer subagent** (e.g. `superpowers:code-reviewer`) for Phase 3's isolated review. Without it, the skill falls back to a `general-purpose` agent with a strict review prompt.

## Install

**The easy way (recommended):** you don't have to move anything by hand. Drag the two skill folders straight into a **Claude Code** or **Codex** session (or just point the agent at them) and say something like *"install these two skills for me"*. The agent knows where skills live (`~/.claude/skills/` for Claude Code) and will put them in the right place for you. Carry straight on into first-run setup below and it'll handle that too.

**The manual way:** copy the two folders into your Claude Code skills directory yourself:

```bash
cp -R ticket-lifecycle managing-project-backlog ~/.claude/skills/
```

## First-run setup

Both skills need to know your project's board IDs (project ID, status-field ID, column option IDs, etc.). The skills are configured per-board via a `board-config.md` file inside each skill folder - both ship as placeholder templates and need to be populated once before use.

**Two ways to do this:**

### Option A - Let Claude Code do it for you (recommended)

After dropping the folders into `~/.claude/skills/`, start a Claude Code session in your repo and say:

> "I've just installed the ticket-lifecycle and managing-project-backlog skills. Please set them up for this project."

Both skills have a first-invocation protocol baked into their `SKILL.md` files: when Claude reads either of them and sees that `board-config.md` still contains `<...>` placeholders, it will run the setup script (or do the equivalent GraphQL discovery inline) before doing anything else. You'll be asked for repo owner, repo name, and project number, then asked to map your columns to the six workflow states the skills use (Epics / Backlog / Prioritized / Doing / Review / Done).

### Option B - Run the script yourself

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/ticket-lifecycle/setup.sh
```

The script will:

1. Ask for the repo owner, repo name, and project number
2. Use `gh api graphql` to discover the project ID, status-field ID, and every column option ID
3. Ask you to map your column names to the workflow terms (your column names can be anything)
4. Write the populated config to **both** skills' `board-config.md` files

Re-run it any time the board structure changes (new columns, renames, etc.).

## What the skills assume about your kanban

The workflow expects columns that correspond to these six states. Your actual column names can differ - `setup.sh` maps your names to the skill terms.

| Workflow term | What it means |
|---|---|
| Epics | Top-level epic issues (groups of sub-issues) |
| Backlog | Planned work, not yet prioritized |
| Prioritized | Next up - ready to pick up |
| Doing | Actively being worked on |
| Review | PR raised, under review / QA |
| Done | Merged |

Extra columns (Icebox, Live, etc.) are fine - the skills just won't use them. Fewer columns also work; setup will let you point multiple terms at the same column if you collapse states.

## Usage

After install + setup, just talk to Claude Code naturally:

- **`managing-project-backlog`** fires automatically when you mention the board, the backlog, "#N", an epic, or moving tickets between states.
- **`ticket-lifecycle`** fires when you ask Claude to work through a batch of tickets ("iterate on #27 #28 #29", "process the prioritized column", "fix the feedback on PR #N").

You can also explicitly type `/ticket-lifecycle` or `/managing-project-backlog` to invoke them.

## Staying up to date

deckhand checks for its own updates, quietly. The first time either skill runs in a session it does a throttled version check (at most once every 24 hours): it reads its local `VERSION`, fetches the latest from this repo, and compares. If a newer version exists it mentions it once and offers to update. If you are already current, offline, or the check fails, it says nothing and carries on. It is best-effort and deliberately low-key, not a background process.

To turn it off, drop an empty file named `.no-update-check` into the skill's folder (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/ticket-lifecycle/.no-update-check`), or just tell your agent to stop checking. To force a check any time, ask "is deckhand up to date?".

## Updating

When you accept an update (or ask for one), the agent updates the skills in place: it fetches the latest files from this repo and overwrites the skill files where they are installed, while preserving your populated `board-config.md` so your board wiring is never clobbered. It then verifies your config is untouched and reports the new version. There is no update script to run and nothing to reinstall; the agent does it and checks its own work.

## Platform support

deckhand is plain Markdown plus `gh` and `curl`, so it runs anywhere an agent can run a shell. Only the install location differs per platform:

- **Claude Code:** drop the skill folders in `~/.claude/skills/` (or let the agent install them, see Install above).
- **Codex:** Codex loads skills natively; place the folders in your Codex skills location and it picks them up.
- **Cursor:** Cursor uses rules rather than skills, so reference the two `SKILL.md` files as project rules (e.g. under `.cursor/rules/`) or from your `AGENTS.md`.

The update check and the update itself both work relative to wherever the skill actually lives, so they behave the same on all three.

## Troubleshooting

- **`gh: command not found`** - install the GitHub CLI and `gh auth login`.
- **`addSubIssue` mutation fails** - your `gh` token may lack the right scopes. Re-run `gh auth refresh -s repo,project`.
- **`setup.sh` reports a missing field** - your board may not have a `Status` field, or it's named something else. Edit `board-config.md` manually after the script runs.
- **The skills can't find `board-config.md`** - `setup.sh` writes to `ticket-lifecycle/references/board-config.md` and `managing-project-backlog/board-config.md`. Confirm both exist.

## Adapting beyond GitHub

The skills are GitHub Projects-shaped today. If you use Linear / Jira / Plane / etc., the workflow discipline (Phase 0-7) still applies; the mechanics (the `gh` and GraphQL calls) would need rewriting against your API. The principles section of `ticket-lifecycle/SKILL.md` is platform-agnostic and worth keeping.

## Releasing (for maintainers)

Versions are just text in the `VERSION` files; nothing on GitHub enforces them. Use the bundled helper to bump all three at once:

```bash
./bump.sh patch   # 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1  (a fix)
./bump.sh minor   # 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0  (new behaviour)
./bump.sh major   # 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0  (breaking change)
./bump.sh 1.4.2   # or set it explicitly
./bump.sh         # no args: show the current version
```

It writes `VERSION`, `ticket-lifecycle/VERSION` and `managing-project-backlog/VERSION`, then prints the git commands to publish (it does not commit or push for you). Once `main` carries a higher number than someone's local copy, the update check offers it to them within a day. Plain semver: patch for fixes, minor for new behaviour, major for breaking changes.
